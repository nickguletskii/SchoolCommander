Moreover, don't bother asking me how to install it, set it up or use it. I have very little interest in this particular project, so there will be zero maintenance or support for it.

What is it for?
---------------
SchoolCommander can send and collect files to and from multiple computers. It can also run PowerShell scripts using PowerShell remoting and "disable" internet by removing the default route.

Disclaimer
----------
This project was built within a week with minimal C# and WPF knowledge. Moreover, very little attention was paid to thread safety, and since a lot of the code is concurrent, this can create a bunch of problems. As a matter of fact, this project is untested and was built solely for my own use. Therefore, **I won't provide**:

* Installation instructions
* Client machine configuration instructions or requirements (all I am going to say is that you need Windows 10 on all machines)
* Documentation
* Support
* Bug fixes

Why open source it at all?
--------------------------
I honestly don't know why I am even doing this. Probably because I want to open-source more of my projects, and this sets a low bar for me, so I will hesitate less when publishing something that I am more proud of.
